        As a passionate advocate for community engagement, I actively volunteer with <span className="font-bold text-white">Volunteer For Bangladesh</span>, where I work for Blood donation camp ( i have donated my blood more than 30 bags ), Rural Development, Youth Empowerment, Public Awareness, Education, Child Health etc. All projects has been done according to United Nation's 17 SDG Goals. Through this experience, I've had the opportunity to lead a project of help disable child. Volunteering has not only allowed me to give back to the community but has also enriched my interpersonal skills and broadened my perspective on societal issues.
